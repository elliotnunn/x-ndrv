This is an experimental driver so try it on your own risk. Known IssuesYour display will be detected as "VGA Display" with standard set of resolutions from 640x480 to 1920x1200. This driver has no hot-plug support so it's safe to change resolution to 640x480 first if you want to connect untested monitor. I recommend to install and set up a VNC server: http://www.macintoshrepository.org/155-vine-vnc-server-3-5-for-os9 so you will be able to connect remotely and switch the resolution manually. Don't forget to add application alias to /System Folder/Startup Items.Install instructions1.
